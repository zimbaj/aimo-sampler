```

### ❌ Contradictory Terms
```
aggressive soft bass (conflicting)
dry reverberant sound (conflicting)
```

### ✅ Consistent
```
aggressive punchy bass
dry tight kick
```

### ❌ Too Many Words
```

## Experimentation Tips

1. **Start simple, add detail:**
   - First: "kick drum"
   - Then: "techno kick drum"
   - Then: "punchy techno kick drum, tight, electronic"

2. **Generate variations:**
   ```powershell
   python -m src.cli generate "your prompt" --variations 5
   ```

3. **Use seeds to iterate:**
   ```powershell
   # Found a good one? Save the seed!
   python -m src.cli generate "bass" --seed 42
   ```

4. **Adjust temperature:**
   - Lower (0.7-0.9) for predictable results
   - Higher (1.1-1.3) for creative surprises

5. **Try genre mixing:**
   ```
   techno kick with acoustic character
   dubstep bass with psytrance rolling quality
   ```
